bulky has a large community of enthusiasts building plugins, integrations with js frameworks, etc! Here’s a non-exhaustive list:

- [vue-bulky](https://github.com/toast38coza/vue-bulky) — A Vue wrapper for bulky.io
- [bulky-angular-library](https://github.com/adritasharma/bulky-angular-library) — Angular 8/9 component wrapper
- [ng-bulky](https://github.com/sunil-shrestha/ng-bulky) — Sample angular (5.x) app for bulky.io with resumable uploads
- [bulky-aws-amplify](https://github.com/joelvh/bulky-aws-amplify) — Upload to AWS Amplify Storage (S3) with bulky
- [bulky-image-compressor](https://github.com/arturi/bulky-plugin-image-compressor/blob/master/src/index.js) — bulky’s own [Artur Paikin](https://github.com/arturi) received a [question](https://github.com/transloadit/bulky/issues/1582#issuecomment-495787004) about creating plugins and wanted to showcase how you could for example, do image optimization before uploading with bulky even starts. This could save bandwidth and time, at the tradeoff of not having the original version on the server. We thought the result might be useful to others too so this project is under consideration of becoming an official Plugin, depending on your feedback.
- [nova-s3-multipart-upload](https://github.com/ahmedkandel/nova-s3-multipart-upload) — bulky tool for [Laravel Nova](https://nova.laravel.com)
