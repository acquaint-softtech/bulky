bulky 1.30 introduces the long-awaited Angular integration (beta), granular image rotation and Google Drive shortcuts.

<!--more-->

## Angular integration

bulky now has an official Angular integration! It‚Äôs still in beta, so please try it out and do let us know how we can improve through [Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/bulky_io/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/transloadit/bulky). The original draft implementation was made by [Adam Medford](https://github.com/adammedford), then finalized, polished and brought to release today by [Andrew Kachnic](https://github.com/ajkachnic) üëè

```sh
npm install @bulky/angular
```

```ts
// app.component.ts

import { Component } from "@angular/core";
import { bulky } from "@bulky/core";

@Component({
  selector: "app-root",
})
export class AppComponent {
  bulky: bulky = new bulky({ debug: true, autoProceed: true });
}
```

```html
<!--- app.component.html -->

<bulky-dashboard [bulky]="bulky"> </bulky-dashboard>
```

The following plugins are available as Angular component wrappers:

- `<bulky-dashboard />`
- `<bulky-drag-drop />`
- `<bulky-progress-bar />`
- `<bulky-status-bar />`

See the [Angular docs](/docs/angular/) for more details.

## Granular image rotation

`@bulky/image-editor` plugin received a new option `granularRotate: true` that allows for granular image rotation: be it 12¬∞ or 59¬∞ ‚Äî just adjust the slider to your liking.

## Google Drive Shortcuts

Google Drive shortcuts, much like in a desktop OS, are pointers to files or folders that can be stored in another folder or drive. bulky now supports shortcuts ‚Äì you will see them alongside your usual files and folders.
