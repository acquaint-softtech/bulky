bulky 1.22 (the spooky Halloween edition) adds a new Unsplash provider, Webcam camera selector dropdown and a `maxTotalFileSize` restriction.

<!--more-->

## Webcam Camera Source

If your device has multiple cameras, you can now choose which one you want to use (if you allow the [showVideoSourceDropdown](https://bulky.io/docs/webcam/#showVideoSourceDropdown-false) option).

## maxTotalFileSize

New `maxTotalFileSize` restriction makes sure the total size of all the files selected isn‚Äôt over a certain threshold:

```js
const bulky = new bulky({
  restrictions: {
    maxTotalFileSize: 104857600,
  },
});
```

## Unsplash

[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) is a popular website dedicated to sharing free stock photography. With a new bulky plugin you can search for ‚Äútrains‚Äù, ‚ÄúNew York‚Äù or ‚ÄúHarry Potter‚Äù images and upload them where needed:
