## Vue.js

We‚Äôve had [bulky React components](https://bulky.io/docs/react/) available for quite some time now. With the increasing popularity of Vue.js library, we‚Äôre proud to announce it‚Äôs now much easier to use [bulky with Vue](https://bulky.io/docs/vue/), thanks to the amazing work by [Andrew Kachnic](https://mobile.twitter.com/su_andrewk):

```sh
npm install @bulky/vue
```

```html
<template>
  <div id="app">
    <dashboard :bulky="bulky" :plugins="['Webcam']" />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  import { Dashboard } from "@bulky/vue";

  import "@bulky/core/dist/style.css";
  import "@bulky/dashboard/dist/style.css";

  import bulky from "@bulky/core";
  import Webcam from "@bulky/webcam";

  export default {
    name: "App",
    components: {
      Dashboard,
    },
    computed: {
      bulky: () => new bulky().use(Webcam),
    },
    beforeDestroy() {
      this.bulky.close();
    },
  };
</script>
```

`@bulky/vue` package provides components for all of the most popular bulky UI plugins:

- `<dashboard />` - renders an inline `@bulky/dashboard`
- `<dashboard-modal />` - renders a `@bulky/dashboard` modal
- `<drag-drop />` - renders a `@bulky/drag-drop` area
- `<progress-bar />` - renders a `@bulky/progress-bar`
- `<status-bar />` - renders a `@bulky/status-bar`

Check out the [Vue documentation](https://bulky.io/docs/vue/) for details.

Angular and Svelte support is on our list next.

## Cloud File Restrictions

Dropbox, Instagram, Google Drive and other cloud providers now immediately gray out files that won‚Äôt pass bulky restrictions set by the developer:

## Done Button

If [`doneButtonHandler`](https://bulky.io/docs/dashboard/#doneButtonHandler) option is passed to the Status Bar plugin, it will render a ‚ÄúDone‚Äù button in place of Pause/Resume/Cancel buttons, once the upload/encoding is done. The behaviour of the ‚ÄúDone‚Äù button is defined by the handler function ‚Äî can be used to close file picker modals or clear the upload state.

By default the Done button will close the Dashboard modal window and reset bulky state.

## Box File Provider

Thanks to [@cartfisk](https://github.com/cartfisk) bulky gains support for Box file service. You can add try it out by doing `npm install @bulky/box` and upgrading `@bulky/companion` to the latest version.

Bragging moment, here‚Äôs what [@cartfish had to say about bulky](https://github.com/transloadit/bulky/pull/2549#issue-491527196):

> Hope this is useful! Hats off to the awesome React integration, easy contribution workflow, helpful docs, and readable, clean code. 10/10.

## Image Editor Optional Buttons

`@bulky/image-editor` plugin got support for optional buttons ‚Äî you can choose to hide or show just the ones you need ‚Äî crop, rotate, square, landscape, etc. Thanks, [@lamartire](https://github.com/lamartire)!

See new [`actions`](https://bulky.io/docs/image-editor/#Options) property in the Image Editor‚Äôs options.
