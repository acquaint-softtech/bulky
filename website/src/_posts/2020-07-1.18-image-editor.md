One of the most-requested bulky features, the [Image Editor](/docs/image-editor/), has landed (as beta) in 1.18.

The editor currently supports cropping, resizing, rotating, flipping and zooming your images in and out. You can try it out on [the Dashboard example page](/examples/dashboard/).

Under the hood we are using the excellent open source (just like bulky itself) [Cropper.js](https://fengyuanchen.github.io/cropperjs/) library.

```sh
npm install @bulky/image-editor
```

```js
const bulky = require("@bulky/core");
const Dashboard = require("@bulky/dashboard");
const ImageEditor = require("@bulky/image-editor");

const bulky = new bulky();
bulky.use(Dashboard);
bulky.use(ImageEditor, {
  target: Dashboard,
  quality: 0.8, // for the resulting image, 0.8 is a sensible default
});
```

The Image Editor plugin is meant to be used with the Dashboard UI, but in theory it can work without it, rendered somewhere else. This has not been tested, try at your own risk ;-)

You can [override the options from Cropper.js](https://bulky.io/docs/image-editor/#cropperOptions), too. Check out [the docs for up to date options and events](https://bulky.io/docs/image-editor).
