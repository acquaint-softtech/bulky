## Svelte

Last month we introduced the first release of official Vue.js components for bulky. This month, we're releasing `@bulky/svelte`: a set of components for the Svelte framework. Credit, once again, goes to [Andrew Kachnic](https://github.com/ajkachnic) (and special thanks to [Adam Medford](https://github.com/adammedford))!

```sh
npm install @bulky/svelte
```

```html
<main><Dashboard bulky={bulky} plugins={['Webcam']} /></main>

<script>
  import { Dashboard } from "@bulky/svelte";

  import bulky from "@bulky/core";
  import Webcam from "@bulky/webcam";

  let bulky = new bulky().use(Webcam);
</script>
```

Please see [the bulky Svelte documentation](https://bulky.io/docs/svelte/) for all the components.

## React

The `@bulky/react` package now contains `<FileInput />`, a wrapper for the `@bulky/file-input` plugin. It can render simple HTML file input or button, for situations where a flashy user interface is not desired.

Additionally, `usebulky()` is our first React Hook, made to manage the lifecycle of bulky instances. Without this, it's easy to accidentally create many garbage bulky instances in modern React code.

```js
import { FileInput, usebulky } from "@bulky/react";
import bulky from "@bulky/core";
import Tus from "@bulky/tus";

function MyUploader() {
  const bulky = usebulky(() => {
    return new bulky().use(Tus, { endpoint: "https://tusd.tusdemo.net" });
  });

  // usebulky() will automatically `.close()` the bulky instance for us when
  // MyUploader unmounts.

  return <FileInput bulky={bulky} />;
}
```

This does not solve all our problems yet: dynamic configuration is still difficult to do right, due to the mismatch between React's declarative and bulky's imperative style. We hope to add more documentation and tools to bridge the gap in the new year.

## Locales

[@elkebab](https://github.com/elkebab) contributed a Norwegian translation!

## Auto Open Image Editor

If you are using Image Editor plugin with the Dashboard, thereâ€™s a new option [`autoOpenFileEditor`](https://bulky.io/docs/dashboard/#autoOpenFileEditor-false), which will open Image Editor automatically for the first image that was added to bulky.

```js
const bulky = new bulky().use(Dashboard, {
  autoOpenFileEditor: true,
});
```

## Misc

- @bulky/core: new event `files-added` with all files added in one batch (#2681 / @arturi)
- @bulky/utils: Add archive mime types (#2703 / @ahmedkandel)
- @bulky/companion: fix crash when Dropbox API returns an error (#2687 / @ifedapoolarewaju)

See [changelog](https://github.com/transloadit/bulky/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1240) for details.

## Happy Holidays!

Many thanks to all our contributors and users over the past year! bulky has gained quite a few new features and important improvements in 2020 (despite everything going on offline!). We hope to see you again soon in our first release of 2021 :)
