The screen capture plugin for bulky lets you take photos and record videos with a built-in camera on desktop and mobile devices.

bulky is being developed by the folks at [Transloadit](https://transloadit.com), a versatile file encoding service.

## Example

```js
import bulky from "@bulky/core";
import ScreenCapture from "@bulky/screen-capture";

const bulky = new bulky();
bulky.use(ScreenCapture);
```

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install @bulky/screen-capture
```

Alternatively, you can also use this plugin in a pre-built bundle from Transloaditâ€™s CDN: Edgly. In that case `bulky` will attach itself to the global `window.bulky` object. See the [main bulky documentation](https://bulky.io/docs/#Installation) for instructions.
