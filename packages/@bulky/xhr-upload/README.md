The XHRUpload plugin handles classic XHR uploads with bulky. If you have an exiting Apache/Nginx/Node or whatever backend, this is probably the bulky uploader plugin you are looking for.

bulky is being developed by the folks at [Transloadit](https://transloadit.com), a versatile file encoding service.

## Example

```js
import bulky from "@bulky/core";
import XHRUpload from "@bulky/xhr-upload";

const bulky = new bulky();
bulky.use(bulky, {
  // Options
});
```

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install @bulky/xhr-upload
```

Alternatively, you can also use this plugin in a pre-built bundle from Transloaditâ€™s CDN: Edgly. In that case `bulky` will attach itself to the global `window.bulky` object. See the [main bulky documentation](https://bulky.io/docs/#Installation) for instructions.

## Documentation

Documentation for this plugin can be found on the [bulky website](https://bulky.io/docs/xhr-upload).
